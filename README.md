1.heart disease prediction using machine learning 
Using a machine learning approach, we predict heart disease in humans based on parameters like blood pressure and thalach (maximum heart rate achieved). By analyzing these features, we can determine if a person has heart disease or not.
2. The classification of polyps using machine learning
We classify polyps using deep learning techniques to distinguish between polyp and non-polyp images. This approach aids in early detection and accurate diagnosis of polyps.
